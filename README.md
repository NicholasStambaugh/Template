# Website Built in React

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and [Bootstrap CSS](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/LICENSE) was used for a lot of the page design.

The homepage is built in `html`, `css`, and `javascript`.
  
My custom admin framework was used to bootstrap survey components, which are built from [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/form-library) Form Library using `JSON` (a data transmission extension of JavaScript) to transmit data.  

Backend is JavaScript, using REST API to a Salesforce custom object. You can view the framework for this in  `APITest.js`.

CSS and JS files for the HTML outside of the survey are located in the assets folder (for the landing page, Why? page, etc.).

# GOALS

1. ~~Build basic website landing page and navigation using html, css, and js.~~
2. ~~Add React and SurveyJS to website.
3. ~~Connect the two. A button on the landing page to load React app and SurveyJS.
4. Build a custom object in Salesforce to store the data as well as any admin work for that.
5. Connect backend survey responses via REST API to that custom object. Test.
7. Finish Building the Survey in SurveyJS.
8. Finish Stylization.
9. Start production build. Build .NET or Ruby on Rails Framework and add elements.
10. Launch.





# For Developer Use
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
